# Audio Intelligence Studio - Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Upload Issues

### Common Upload Errors and Solutions

#### 1. "Upload failed" Error
**Symptoms**: Generic upload failure message
**Solutions**:
- Check if backend is running: `http://localhost:3001/api/test`
- Verify file format is supported (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, M4A)
- Ensure file size is under 100MB
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

#### 2. CORS Error
**Symptoms**: "Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3001' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy"
**Solutions**:
- Ensure backend CORS is properly configured
- Check that both servers are running on correct ports
- Restart both frontend and backend servers

#### 3. "No audio file provided" Error
**Symptoms**: Backend receives request but no file
**Solutions**:
- Check file input is properly configured
- Verify FormData is correctly created
- Ensure file is actually selected

#### 4. Network Error
**Symptoms**: "Failed to fetch" or connection refused
**Solutions**:
- Check if backend server is running: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001`
- Verify port 3001 is not blocked by firewall
- Restart backend server

## üöÄ Quick Fixes

### 1. Restart Both Servers
```bash
# Kill existing processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Start backend
cd backend
npm start

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd ..
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Server Status
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/test

# Check if frontend is running
curl http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Test Upload with Simple HTML
Open `test-upload.html` in your browser to test upload functionality directly.

## üîß Configuration Issues

### OpenAI API Key
**Problem**: Processing fails after upload
**Solution**: Set your OpenAI API key in `backend/config.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

### File Upload Directory
**Problem**: "ENOENT: no such file or directory" error
**Solution**: Ensure `backend/uploads/` directory exists:
```bash
cd backend
mkdir uploads
```

## üêõ Debug Steps

### 1. Check Backend Logs
Look for error messages in the backend terminal when uploading.

### 2. Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for error messages.

### 3. Test Backend Directly
```bash
curl -X POST -F "audio=@test-file.wav" http://localhost:3001/api/process
```

### 4. Check File Permissions
Ensure the backend has write permissions to the uploads directory.

## üìã Common Issues Checklist

- [ ] Backend server running on port 3001
- [ ] Frontend server running on port 5173
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured
- [ ] Uploads directory exists
- [ ] File format is supported

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the logs**: Look at both frontend and backend console output
2. **Test with simple file**: Try uploading a small WAV file first
3. **Use test page**: Open `test-upload.html` to isolate the issue
4. **Check network**: Ensure no proxy or VPN is interfering
5. **Restart everything**: Kill all Node.js processes and restart
